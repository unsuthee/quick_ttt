The implementation of the minimax algorithm on tic-tac-toe game during my flight back home from the vacation.

I was sitting on the airplane on my way back from Hawaii to California with no internet access. I was bored and somehow remembered that Peter Novig implemented the spell corrector while he was on the airplane. Inspired by him, I thought it would be a good practice to implement a simple program to play Tic Tac Toe. I implemented a simple Minimax without using any pruning. It works just fine because the search space for this game is only 9!
